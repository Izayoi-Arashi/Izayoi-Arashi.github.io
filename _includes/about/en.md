##### About Blog

- It's always cool to have a simple personal website
  <br>
  On summer vacation three years ago, right after the entrance exams, I broke away from my busy school schedule and thought of embarking on something that I was interested in. Since I was a kid, I've been interested in the Internet and some technology products, so I started to cut my teeth on it. By chance, I learned from my cousin (who is now considered my senior because he studied the same major) that he has his own personal website. So there is the idea of creating a personal website. At that time, I had no professional knowledge, but only through self-study plus my cousin's guidance to complete this work. After about 3 days, my personal website was completed. But due to the high server cost, this personal website only lasted for one summer vacation. Maybe it's because of a little bit of obsession? During the period from the first personal website to the present personal website, I had the idea of making another personal website from time to time, until now I have it again.

      Since I'm busy now, I've borrowed [Hux](https://huangxuan.me/)'s blog template for this new site. You can jump to his blog template repository directly from the github link below. The image element part uses Itsuki，紺屋鴉江，ののこ thank you to all three artists for their paintings. In the future I will update some content here from time to time (if I still remember), if you see this post you also have your own personal website or blog you can send me the link to your website through my email, we can make a friend and hang a friend link on each other's website.

##### About Customized Roles

- It's all online, so at least change your image!

   My full name is Izayoi Arashi, Izayoi  is taken from the last name of Touhou Project's Izayoi Sakuya , because I like this character very much, plus it has the meaning of night itself, and I'm a night owl, so I took “Izayoi” as the last name of my self-defined image.

   As for the name Arashi, it is because of the inspiration of Haruki Murakami's words. “When you pass through a storm, you're not the same person you were before.” Arashi means storm, and I hope that my heart is as passionate as a storm, and that I can pass through the storm and become a self-reliant person through trials and tribulations.
